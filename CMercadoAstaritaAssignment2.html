They are both already reading and writing above grade level. So I know as long as I pursue,they will continue to pursue and reach every avenue of educational success.</p>

<p class="family big-ws big-space">I also love the piano. its a gift of comfort and expression. its a passion of god, so i pursue it. Everything about me is based on music and the ivory keys. When you hear me play, your hearing my heart beat. You crack open my skull and all you will see is music notes. I play my story on these keys every sound is from me. It determines the way I sing, what I feel, all I play and write, to what I see about this life. </p>
